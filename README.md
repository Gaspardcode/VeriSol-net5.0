# SolBooT

SolBooT (Solidity to Boogie Transpilor) is a fork from a [Microsoft Research project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/verisol-a-formal-verifier-for-solidity-based-smart-contracts/). It is aims at translating
programs in Solidity language to programs in [Boogie](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie) intermediate verification language.

Unfortunately the Microsoft Research Project stopped supporting new versions of Solidity around 0.4.23. Oldest version is at the time of writing is 0.8.0.
This fork intends to extend the previous efforts in order to support the latest solidity versions.
